      <a href="#"> <h1>Computer Hardware</h1></a>

      <p>
        The physical components of a computer, such as its chassis, random
        access memory (RAM), CPU, monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer data
        storage, graphics card, sound card, speakers, and motherboard, are
        referred to as computer hardware.  Software, on the other hand, is a
        collection of instructions that may be stored and executed by hardware.
        Software is referred to as "soft" because it is flexible, but hardware
        is referred to as "hard" because it is rigid in terms of modifications.
        Software often instructs hardware to carry out any command or
        instruction. A useful computer system is one that combines hardware and
        software, while there are also systems that use simply hardware.
      </p>
      <h5 class="font-weight-bold">Case</h5>
      <p>
        The majority of the system's parts are enclosed by the computer case. It
        controls and directs the flow of cooling air across internal components
        and offers mechanical support and protection for internal components
        including the motherboard, disc drives, and power supplies. The
        enclosure also functions as a component of the system to regulate the
        electromagnetic interference the computer emits and safeguards interior
        components from electrostatic discharge. While desktop cases offer less
        expansion capability, large tower cases typically stand on the floor and
        can accommodate several disc drives or other accessories. A video
        display is included into all-in-one design cases. Computers that are
        portable or laptop-sized need casings that protect them from impacts.
        Hobbyists could use paint, colourful lights, or other features, in an
        activity called case modding.
      </p>

      <h5>Power supply</h5>
      <p>
        Alternating current (AC) electric power is transformed into low-voltage
        direct current (DC) electricity for the computer by a power supply unit,
        or PSU. A built-in rechargeable battery can power laptops.  Power
        MOSFETs (power metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors) are
        commonly utilised in the converters and regulator circuits of the
        switched-mode power supply (SMPS), which is what the PSU typically
        employs.
      </p>

      <h5>Motherboard</h5>
      <p>
        A computer's motherboard is its primary part. It is a board with
        integrated circuitry that connects the CPU, RAM, disc drives (CD, DVD,
        hard disc, or any others), and any peripherals attached via ports or
        expansion slots. A typical computer's integrated circuit (IC) chip
        houses billions of tiny metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect
        transistors (MOSFETs).
      </p>

      <h5>Storage devices</h5>
      <p>
        Any computational gear or digital medium used for storing, transferring,
        and extracting data files and objects is referred to as a storage
        device. It can be internal or external to a computer, server, or other
        comparable computing device and contain and store data both transiently
        and permanently. A key feature and essential part of computers is data
        storage.
      </p>

      <h5>Input device</h5>
      <p>
        Users can enter data into systems or manage their functioning using
        input devices. A mouse and keyboard are standard on personal computers,
        although touchpads are frequently used on laptops in place of mice.
        Webcams, microphones, joysticks, and image scanners are among additional
        input devices.
      </p>

      <h5>Output device</h5>
      <p>
        The senses of people are considered when designing output devices. For
        instance, monitors show text that is readable and speakers create
        audible sound. [12] Other examples of such gadgets include printers and
        Braille embossers.
